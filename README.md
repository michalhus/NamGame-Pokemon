# Name-Game-iOS

A fun game app that helps in learning Pokemons' names by mathing correct name to the picture of multiple Pokemons. 
Name Game app consists of two different game modes, “Practice Mode” and "Timed Mode". While both mode are similar their funcitonality
slightly varies. In “Practice Mode”, failure to match Target Pokemon Name to its picture ends with Game Over. Wherease, "Timed Mode" ends after
provide time ends. Also, “Practice Mode” does not utilize Core Data functionality as user would start new game each time after exiting.
